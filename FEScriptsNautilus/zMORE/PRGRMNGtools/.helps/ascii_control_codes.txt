ASCII CONTROL CODES - for decimal 0 thru 37 (hex 00 thru 1F ; octal 000 thru 037)
###################

The ONE-BYTE control codes below can be pasted into text files.

For example, the Escape code (corresponding to decimal 27) is handy to paste into
files such as script files that send control codes and commands to printers.

The control codes are in the FIRST BYTE (character) of each line, below.

The NUL code (octal 000) was causing a problem in getting the rest of the
lines into this file, so the first byte of the NUL line is simply a space,
NOT the NUL control code (hex 00 or 8 zero bits). [The NUL code is interpreted
as an end-of-file indicator by some programs/commands.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
      The control codes will display differently in different editors or
      text display utilities.

-----
gedit:

      If you bring up this text file in the 'gedit' Gnome text editor,
      the ONE-byte control codes show as a little square, the size of
      ONE character.
      For example:
      The one-byte 'escape-code' (corresponding to decimal 27, hex 1B),
      shows as a little square --- with '0 0' in a tiny little first row
      within the square and '1 B' in the tiny second row.

      In 'gedit', there are a few codes for which you will not see the
      'little square'. You will see that the 'line-feed' and 'carriage-return'
      lines appear as if a blank line is above them --- and the columns of
      text are shifted to the left.

      Also in 'gedit', the 'horizontal tab'  line has the columns of text
      shifted to the right --- and no little square.

      Because such shifts and blank lines make it difficult to tell just where
      the control code was, a period (.) was put on the right of each control
      code. So the control code is (or was) just to the left of that period
      (or on the blank/null line just above the period).

-----
nedit:

      In the 'nedit' text editor, the ONE-byte 'escape-code' is rendered
      as the FIVE characters '<esc>'.

      The other codes are also shown as 2 or 3 characters with a less-than
      sign on the left and a greater-than sign on the right.

      The 'horizontal-tab' and the 'line-feed' lines appear like they did
      in 'gedit'. (See above.)

------
Tcl-Tk:

      In the text widget of a Tcl-Tk file browser, like in 'xpg' of the FE
      (Freedom Environment) system, the ONE-byte control codes are rendered
      as FOUR characters. Example: the 'escape-code' is rendered as
      '\x1b'. In other words, each control code is rendered as '\x'
      (back-slash and lower-case x) followed by a 2 character hex code.

      In the text widget of Tcl-Tk, there are a few exceptions. Some codes
      are rendered as back-slash and a lower-case letter:
          - The BEL code is rendered as 'back-slash, then a'.
          - The BS (backspace) code is rendered as 'back-slash, then b'.
          - The VT (vertical tab) code is rendered as 'back-slash, then v'.
          - The FF (form feed) code is rendered as 'back-slash, then f'.

      The 3 codes 'line-feed', 'carriage-return', and 'horizontal-tab' are
      rendered like 'gedit'. (See above.)

------
kwrite:

      The 'kwrite' window comes up slower than the others, the first time
      that 'kwrite' is invoked in a session. When the 'kwrite' window appears,
      it shows the control codes in column one as little one character symbols
      --- for example, some of them look like musical notes --- one symbol looks
      an eighth note, one looks like a quarter note, one looks like a pair of
      eighth notes.

      The line-feed, carriage-return, and horizontal-tab characters are
      shown like 'gedit' (see above) and the Tcl-Tk text widget.
